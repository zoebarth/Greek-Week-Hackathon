Cultural Calendar by Alpha Gamma Delta 


## Inspiration
At Georgia Tech, there's an abundance of cultural events and activities, but no easy way to discover where and when stuff is going on. 

## What it does
This interactive calendar allows students to find cultural events and holidays celebrations at Georgia Tech. Multi-cultural and religious organizations will be able to add their event to the calendar to help get the word out to the campus community.

## How we built it
This calendar was built using an open source Bootstrap framework to help format the calendar and its entries. Programming was done in JavaScript (Vanilla JS), HMTL, and CSS.

## Challenges we ran into
It was quite hard to populate the calendar with relevant events since there's not one centralized calendar for cultural events at Georgia Tech. However, this challenge did prove that there is a real need at Georgia Tech for a calendar like ours!
